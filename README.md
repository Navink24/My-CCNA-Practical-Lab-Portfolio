# My-CCNA-Practical-Lab-Portfolio
Hands-on practice labs for the Cisco CCNA 200-301 certification using Cisco Packet Tracer. Building networking skills one configuration at a time.
This repository contains all the configuration files and Packet Tracer (`.pkt`) topologies created as part of my practical CCNA skill-building series. Each folder corresponds to a week of focused study and practical lab application.
